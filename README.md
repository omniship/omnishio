Omniship is a shipping library for PHP that allows you to generate accurate shipment rates, get tracking information, generate shipping labels and much more.

It has been designed with a consistent and clean API in mind with the sole purpose to allow you to do these tasks with less code so you can focus on doing the real work quicker.

Omniship handles all the communication with the carrier's API and returns the data in a usable and clean format.

This package is compliant with the FIG standards [PSR-1][link-psr-1], [PSR-2][link-psr-2] and [PSR-4][link-psr-4] to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP. If you notice any compliance oversights, please send a patch via pull request.
